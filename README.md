- 👋 Hi, I’m @aousterhout.  I have a built a production management solution using ColdFusion that our cookie business has been using for 20+ years.  I recenently began to add on a C# app that ussed image process to count work,  perform quality control
- 👀 I’m interested in open source C# packages that help me develop AI around working with images.  This includes counting cookie on a cookie sheet (edible ones!), determining their x-y coordinates on the cookie to drive robotics, and and robitic related libriaries
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on manufacturing related open source in CFML.
